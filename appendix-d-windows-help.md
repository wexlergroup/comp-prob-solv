## Using Git Bash on Windows

```{admonition} Thanks to Charlie Li
:class: tip
Special thanks to Charlie Li for putting together these clear instructions on how to use **Git Bash** on Windows.
```

For this course, Windows users are encouraged to use **Git Bash** as their terminal. Git Bash provides a Unix-like shell environment, making it easier to run commands that are consistent with examples shown in lecture and documentation.

### How to Open Git Bash

1. **From the Start Menu**

   * Search for *Git Bash* in the Windows search bar and click to open.
   * Git should already be installed on most Windows systems.

2. **From File Explorer**

   * Navigate to the folder you want.
   * Right-click inside the folder window.
   * Select **Show more options → Open Git Bash here**.

3. **From VS Code**

   * Open the terminal panel in VS Code.
   * Click the small arrow (`⌄`) next to the **+** button.
   * Select **Git Bash** (the default is usually PowerShell).

### Why Git Bash?

* The command syntax matches the Unix shell used on macOS and Linux.
* It is widely recommended by computer science instructors and is already included with Git for Windows.
